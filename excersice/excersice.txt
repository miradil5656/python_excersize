Convert a string into a list of strings
Let's say that you get the input in a function that is a string, but it is supposed to be a list:
You don�t need it in that format. You need it to be a list:
Or maybe you the following response from an API call:
Rather than bothering with complicated regular expressions, all you have to do is import the module ast and then call its method literal_eval:
That�s all you need to do.
Now you will get the result as a list, or list of lists, namely like the following:
